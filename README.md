# SafeTaxi-MSFS2020
SafeTaxi is a Taxi speed limiter addon for MSFS2020. 

## What's the point of using this addon?
This addon is meant for people who own controllers with limited throttle axis ranges or for keyboard users which prevents them from accurately controlling the aircraft speed while taxiing.

## Does it work with all aircraft's?
It works with all vanilla aircraft's and FBW A320X.
I haven't tested this addon with other products apart of the mentioned above, but if you wish any specific aircraft to be supported feel free to drop a request.
